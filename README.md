# Shop-Shop Redux Refactor

## Objectives
- WHEN I review the appâ€™s store, THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store, THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state, THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store, THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions, THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
